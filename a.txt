whenever we se a file from frontend to experss server ; then express server bydefault can not read that file 
because  seerver did'nt understand the file format to solve this problem we use multer  package
use it on routes



we did'nt store files on server because there we have have acess of ssd and hardisks so we store  the in cloud storage 
,because cloud storage store our file and ten we can acess whenever we  want cloud storage like cloudynary ,
ImageKit  so storage req for file and response with url and by that url we can acees the file
